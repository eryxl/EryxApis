# EryxApis
A current WIP made by yours truly one day I will get a good name for it but for right now it is just eryxapis this repository is made to simplify basic but time-consuming js code you can install the API by putting this link into a ```<script>``` function ```//eryxapis.netlify.app/time.js``` as of right now it just gives you clocks to make a clock with ```time.js``` you can use ```milClock()``` to start a 12-hour clock and you can display the clock with ``` <div id=12clock></div>``` to display the 12-hour clock to display a 24-hour clock you can use the ```standClock()``` to initialize the clock and then display it with ```<div id="24Clock"></div>```
